Our original visual idea was to create waterdrops that embody unusual physics and dictate it to move in 3-D space following algorithmic pattern. We were able to realistic waterdrops material as well as flows using Nvidia Flex; we also figured out a way to connect Tensorflow to the game engine. However, the core problem lies in connecting the two pieces together to dictate the movements of particle systems. The challenge is that game engines are usually for simulating the real world, while we look for creative movements of objects that don’t follow physical rules. Now we are looking at other animation tools like Houdini and Touch Designer.

In the meantime, Mika decided to scrape the idea of drones as we haven‘t had any result contacting Intel and we are not sure how it would be a meaningful add-on. For example, by asking ourselves what the physical form the drones should follow, we realized we can’t come up with a convincing answer. 

Focusing on animations, we further considered the idea of a giant liquid pool with underlying mechanisms beneath it. It’s reflective when it‘s still. Using the clustering movement data we have from algorithms, we can orchestrate the reflective liquid to behave in certain ways. In an attempt to brainstorm more concrete visuals, as well as the tools for creating data-driven 3D animations, Mike has reached out to animation experts at Brooklyn Research Group and we are having several meetings with them in the weeks to come. We will keep you posted on what we learn from them!
