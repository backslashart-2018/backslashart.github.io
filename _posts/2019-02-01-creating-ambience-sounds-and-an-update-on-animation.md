In the past weeks, we narrowed down on both the artistic concept and technical controls of the aural component. Howie provided us with the picture below for illustration. The idea is to use a synthetic voice, vocaloid synth, to “speak out” the attributes of the synthetic humans while those words and phrases may be blurred, stretched and pitch-shifted. It is recognizable in the beginning and end, going in and out. At the same time, the ambience is an ever-changing background pad sound that is liquidy and ethereal.

We used Max to connect to the data server and prototyped a simple data mapping of the coordinates of the first point fetched from the server to attributes of the pad sound in a scaled fashion, in order to create slight variations in the output sound. We want the background to be changing but in very subtle ways, as its main purpose is to serve as an ambience for the animation and a backdrop for synthetic voice. Listen to the Max + Ableton generated sound here:

Here is a snapshot of part of the Max program:

In addition, we have iterated on the animation and below is our latest creation.
