Based on the previous exploration of GANs and video-accompanying sounds, we built several variations on top. We connected these variations end-to-end to create a long [GIF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/129lpfcto2HIL1gQ0wKw1O6EWWgKAteUw/view) showing what the audience might experience at an installation. We also discussed how we can create spatialized sound given the position of speakers by taking x, y, and z positions of the points. As a point moves closer, the sound representing that point also becomes louder. Moreover, we talked about instrumentations using clusters, the mapping of different variables (i.e. distance to center), and tonal adjustments based on scale and range. We figured out many details of the aural component while keeping it adaptable to the final visual experience.

During the meeting, Mika brought up the idea of using metaphors to underscore the concept of “new humans”, little particles in a vast universe in the backdrop. These metaphors could be droplets in ocean waves, or fire amber from firecrackers. These accented particles follow the physics on earth but we want to create animations such that the particles are also able to have new behaviors. For example, water [flowing up and down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0Wqw1rIs6A) or sideways like [the scene from Terminator 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq5ydeWWr4A). In terms of the tools, we are deciding between P5.js, Unity and Unreal to see what works best for artistic purposes. In the coming weeks, we will be programming these particles to do something unreal.
