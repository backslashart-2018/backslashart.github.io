In the past weeks, we used t-SNE and GANs to create an extended visualization that will be used for the final simulation. By tweaking the hyperparameters of t-SNE, we were able to generate a sequence of interesting movements of points that portray expansion and convergence. This skeletal visualization will be used to produce a much more elaborate and detailed simulation on a different platform. We're currently exploring Unreal and Unity, which are used for game development and detailed graphics on a high-performing hardware, and p5.js, which is used to create animations on web browsers with less computing power.

We also discussed how we can create spatialized sound given the position of speakers by taking x, y, and z positions of the points. As a point moves closer, the sound representing that point also becomes louder. Moreover, we talked about instrumentations using clusters, the mapping of different variables (i.e. distance to center), and tonal adjustments based on scale and range. We figured out many details of the aural component while keeping it adaptable to the final visual experience.

As we plan out our next phase, we explored different metaphors to underscore the concept of â€œnew humans." We want to capture the idea of insignificance in vastness and the multi-faceted human nature. These metaphors can be represented in various forms, such as ocean waves, ember, or mercury. In the final work, we want to create simulations such that the particles also exhibit new behaviors against the physics of the earth as seen in this [water video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0Wqw1rIs6A) and [the scene from Terminator 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq5ydeWWr4A).
