In the past weeks, we worked on connecting separate components together for the final package delivery. Especially, we wanted to augment the sound component by directly integrating with Unreal Engine to allow the visual to trigger changes in the sound. The initial plan was to run the sound and animation programs separately, yet for a more dramatic and cohesive experience we decided to tie the two together to show the causal relationship between them. In order to bridge the two programs, we are experimenting with an OSC plugin to establish a sender and receiver connection. 

Furthermore, we are making final adjustments on the visual side. In the previous version, most of the visual qualities were aligned with Mika's vision, yet the speed was uniform and constant. For the next and final version, we want the speed to be changing and show acceleration to better capture the idea of organic movement. 

The sculpture is still in development in partnership with Brooklyn Research. The following is the latest experiment they shared with us:
