Most of the progress in the past weeks was on the animation to match Mika's direction more closely. More specifically, two main improvements were implemented: speed control and orbiting camera movements. First, the speed control in the animation refers to the rate in which the metaballs move in any direction. Previously, it was set to a constant, but Mika wanted the metaballs to slow down and speed up to make the animation more dynamic. This scene in the movie Sherlock Holmes captures what she envisions.

After much investigation, we discovered that the metaball plugin uses a time step variable to dictate the metaballs' movement. By controlling the variable, we could implement the speed control as such:

Secondly, the orbiting camera movement needed to be added. Here's the reference video Mika shared.

Here's how the animation looks in the animation:

Lastly, the sculpture prototype from Brooklyn Research Group is now connected to the Processing script that runs the Navier Stokes algorithm. The following videos show how they look.

In terms of the timeline, we plan to conclude our project in mid-April.
