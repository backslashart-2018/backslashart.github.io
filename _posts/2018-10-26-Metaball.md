In the last weeks, our main focus was experimenting with different methods to create high fidelity fluid simulations. Previously, we incorporated the NVIDIA Flex plugin to prototype as it is widely used to generate real-time fluid simulations in games. Having a pre-built library that generates real-time simulations was an attractive option, yet we realized that it is hard to override the built-in physics and dictate specific particle positions to achieve our aesthetic objectives. 

After the initial consultation with a fluid animator, we adopted a new method called metaballs. Its strongest appeal was that we could control various aspects of the simulation, including particle positions, refraction, shadow and so forth. Fortunately, we did not have to abandon the game engine with which we have been experimenting. Furthermore, we can now use C++ to bridge the data pipeline with the metaballs. By utilizing custom nodes, we made a simple prototype to test out distance functions and other parameters as shown below.

In the coming weeks, we plan to populate the simulation with the data points from the t-SNE algorithm. As the tentative deadline approaches, we are also in contact with Brooklyn Research Group to set a development plan for the hardware component of the installation.
