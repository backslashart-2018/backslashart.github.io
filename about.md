title: About us

We are Christy Cui and Jacob Lee, blogging about our experiences as [\art](https://backslashart.org/) fellows.

\Art, pronounced "backslash art", is an annual fellowship at Cornell Tech that partners artists with Cornell Tech graduates to create art that escapes convention: new art forms, and new art technologies. 

This year, we are honored to be partnering with [Mika Tajima](http://mikatajima.com/) to create something meaningful and unique.
